- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ronniieeee
- ğŸŒ‡ By day, I don't do anything related to IT or software development. I have a boring desk job.
- ğŸŒƒ By night, I like to try and code...
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding. But I find it easier to learn with some project, rather than reading abstract concepts.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about PHP and JS, and how to apply it to my weird ideas.
